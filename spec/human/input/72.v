(* def will_it_fly(q,w):
'''
Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

Example:
will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False
# 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
# it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
# 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
# 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
